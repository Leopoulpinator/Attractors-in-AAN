This script is a solution for the initial problem that we had.
This solution consists in forgot the last condition about the fact that we cannot meet a new global state out of our current attractor.
This condition has been added manually in the python script, and is now resolved in python.
This solution is a bit disappointed because it only works for synchrone semantic (with asynchrone the initial script works, but what about others semantics..?).
But at least it solves out initial problem.
